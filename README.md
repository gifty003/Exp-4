# Exp - 4 HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:

To develop a project hospital management System using star UML tools.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:

1.	Room Booking and Reservations: The system enables customers to check room availability, view details, and book rooms online or in person. It also manages check-in, check-out, and updates room statuses.

2.	Billing and Payments: The system generates invoices for guests, supports multiple payment options, and provides digital or printed receipts for easy checkout.

3.	Staff and Inventory Management: Managers assign tasks to staff for housekeeping and maintenance, while the system tracks inventory and sends alerts for low stock levels.

4.	Notifications and Reporting: Automated notifications inform guests of booking details and reminders, while reports on bookings, revenue, and occupancy rates help improve hotel management.
